      An omelet or omelette is an egg dish characterized by an elongated oval shape with a smooth surface. The inside
      typically has a juicy, soft consistency and there should be no browning on the outside.

        Then melt the butter in a pan and pour the egg mixture into the pan with a ladle - swirling the pan to
        distribute the egg mixture evenly in the pan - and let it set (do not turn it).
